# Explain ?. and !. in dart

In Dart, `?.` and `!` (also `!.`) are **null safety** operators that serve different purposes when working with nullable types. Here's a quick breakdown:

---

### `?.` — **Null-aware access operator**
- Used to **safely access a property or method** on an object that might be null.
- If the object is null, it **returns null instead of throwing an error**.

#### Example:
```dart
String? name;
print(name?.length); // prints: null
```
> `name` is null, so `name?.length` returns null without crashing.

---

### `!` — **Null assertion operator**
- Used to **force Dart to treat a nullable value as non-null**.
- If the value **is null at runtime**, it **throws an error**.

#### Example:
```dart
String? name;
// print(name!.length); // Runtime error if name is null
```

> You’re telling Dart: “Trust me, this won’t be null.” If you're wrong, it crashes.

---

### `!.` — Not a special operator
- This is just a combination: first `!` to assert non-null, then `.` to access.
- **`name!.length`** means: assert `name` is not null, then get `length`.

### Quick Summary

| Operator | Meaning                           | When to Use                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `?.`     | Null-aware access                 | When the variable might be null             |
| `!`      | Null assertion                    | When you're sure the value isn't null       |
| `!.`     | Assert non-null then access       | Same as above, for accessing a member       |
